# Vending Machine
Vending machine with Java using Build pattern

This vending machine project allows you to do many things: it creates many of these vending machines, coins, and products (fruits) that must be available in a specific external API, and it also allows you to associate these coins and products with an existing vending machine and make operations like buy fruits, insert coins, take out some coins or products from your vending machine, and some other actions.
